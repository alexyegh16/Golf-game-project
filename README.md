# Golf-game-project
This project was done in order to receive a DEC in Computer Science and Mathematics in Cegep. It is a game of golf that simulates the physics of a ball in motion. There are three levels of increasing difficulty where certain factors change, like gravity or friction. To play the game, the user must drag the mouse to shoot the ball in the direction they wish.
Note: pygame-ce must be installed to run the game
